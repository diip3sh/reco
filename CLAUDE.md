# CLAUDE.md

Coding rules, Swift/SwiftUI conventions and git workflow live in AGENTS.md — follow them:

@AGENTS.md

This file covers what AGENTS.md doesn't: how to build this fork, what it adds on top of upstream
[jsattler/BetterCapture](https://github.com/jsattler/BetterCapture), where that code lives, and what's next.

## What this fork is

BetterCapture is a sandboxed macOS menu bar screen recorder (ScreenCaptureKit + AVAssetWriter).
This fork is working towards a free Screen Studio / CleanShot X alternative: record input telemetry
now, build an editor (auto-zoom, smooth cursor, backgrounds) on top of it later.

Architecture of the original app: `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`, `docs/architecture/OUTPUT.md`,
`docs/concepts/VIDEO.md`, `docs/concepts/AUDIO.md`.

## Build, run, test

The project is signed with upstream's team (`DMX24B5FC3`), which you won't have. Build with your
own Apple Development certificate — don't commit signing changes:

```sh
# Find your team ID: the OU= field
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
security find-certificate -c "Apple Development" -p | openssl x509 -noout -subject

TEAM=<YOUR_TEAM_ID>
xcodebuild -scheme BetterCapture -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/bc-build/dd \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development" DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=$TEAM \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER="" build -quiet \
  && { pkill -x BetterCapture; open /tmp/bc-build/dd/Build/Products/Debug/BetterCapture.app; }
```

- Tests: same command with `test` instead of `build -quiet` (Swift Testing, 182 tests).
- Lint: `swiftlint lint --quiet <files>` — new code must be clean. Pre-existing warnings:
  `AssetWriter.swift` (file_length, type_body_length, 2× function_body_length) and
  `RecorderViewModel.swift` (file_length, type_body_length). Don't make them worse; SwiftLint skips
  extensions for type_body_length, so new logic goes in same-file extensions or new types.
- Keep build output outside the repo (`/tmp/bc-build`). If the build fails with "There is no
  XCFramework found", `rm -rf /tmp/bc-build` and rebuild (moved DerivedData breaks SPM paths).
- **Don't use ad-hoc signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="-"`)**: the code hash changes every build, so
  macOS forgets the Screen Recording permission and prompts forever. If a permission gets stuck:
  `tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.sattlerjoshua.BetterCapture`, then relaunch.
- New `.swift` files need no pbxproj edit (file-system synchronized groups).
- App target defaults to MainActor isolation (`SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`), Swift 5
  language mode. Types used off the main actor must be marked `nonisolated`.

## Features added in this fork

Branches are stacked: `feat/input-telemetry` → `feat/cursor-sprites` → `feat/pause-resume`.

### F1 — Input telemetry sidecar (`feat/input-telemetry`)

Optional setting **Settings → Video → Advanced → Record Input Telemetry** (off by default). Writes
`<video>.telemetry.json` next to each recording with cursor positions, clicks, scrolls and
keystrokes (key code + modifiers only, never characters), all on the video timeline.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Model/InputTelemetry.swift` | Codable file format, pure conversion helpers (`videoTime`, `rebased`, `videoPixel`, `topLeft`, `modifierNames`) |
| `Service/InputTelemetryRecorder.swift` | Cursor polling (≤60 Hz), global mouse/scroll monitor, listen-only key `CGEventTap`, writes the sidecar |
| `Service/CaptureGeometryTracker.swift` | Per-frame `SCStreamFrameInfo` geometry on the capture queue, stored only on change |
| `Service/AssetWriter.swift` | `sessionStartTime` (host time of file time 0) |
| `ViewModel/RecorderViewModel.swift` | Starts telemetry after the last `try` in `startRecording`, writes the sidecar in `stopRecording` while the output folder's security scope is held |

Key facts:
- **Time:** events are stored as host-clock seconds while recording (`NSEvent.timestamp`,
  `CMClockGetHostTimeClock`, SCStream PTS all share it) and rebased at stop by `sessionStartTime`.
- **Position:** locations are global CG points, top-left origin. Map to video pixels with
  `InputTelemetry.videoPixel(for:geometry:)` using the `geometry` entry in effect at that time.
  Verified against real frames for display and window captures.
- **Window shadows:** with "Show Window Shadows" on, SCK draws window + shadow scaled into the frame.
  SCK reports only the shadow's total size, so the top/bottom split uses the measured
  `InputTelemetry.shadowTopFraction = 0.35` (macOS 27). Re-measure if Apple changes shadows.
- **Keystrokes** need Input Monitoring (requested when the toggle is turned on; effective after
  relaunch). Without it `keystrokesAvailable` is false and `keys` is empty.

### F2 — Cursor sprites (`feat/cursor-sprites`)

When telemetry is on, each distinct system cursor image (arrow, I-beam, hand, resize…) is stored once
in the JSON (largest bitmap as base64 PNG, size + hotspot in points), plus a track of when the
cursor changed shape. Lets a future editor redraw the cursor on a video recorded with
**Show Cursor** off. No new setting.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Service/CursorShapeTracker.swift` | Pure dedup by fingerprint (size + hotspot + smallest bitmap's pixels); PNG encoded only for new shapes |
| `Service/InputTelemetryRecorder.swift` | `sampleCursorShape(at:)` reads `NSCursor.currentSystem` at ≤15 Hz |

Risk: `NSCursor.currentSystem` is marked "to be deprecated" with no public replacement. If it starts
returning nil, sprites are simply empty; nothing else breaks.

### F4 — Pause / resume (`feat/pause-resume`, upstream issue #174)

Menu bar **Pause/Resume** button, global shortcut **Pause/Resume Recording** (no default), and
`bettercapture://pause`. The SCStream keeps running while paused (instant resume, macOS recording
indicator stays on); every sample is dropped and the paused time is cut from the file.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Service/RecordingPauses.swift` | Pure struct: per sample, drop (`nil`) or return paused time to subtract |
| `Service/AssetWriter.swift` | `timelineOffset(of:duration:)` rebases every track, the CFR grid and head silence padding by `sessionAnchor + pausedTime`; `pause`/`resume`/`pauseIntervals` in the `// MARK: - Pausing` extension; last frame captured while paused is shown from the resume point |
| `ViewModel/RecorderViewModel.swift` | `isPaused` flag (state stays `.recording`), `togglePause()` extension, timer excludes paused time |
| `Model/InputTelemetry.swift` | `rebased(anchor:duration:pauses:)` drops events inside pauses and shifts later ones |

Audio buffers straddling a pause edge are dropped whole (gap ≤ ~21 ms per edge, marked `ponytail:`).

### Telemetry JSON (version 3)

```
version, keystrokesAvailable,
capture:       { kind: display|window|area, videoSize: [w,h] }
geometry:      [{ time, screenRect, contentRect, boundingRect?, contentScale, scaleFactor }]
cursor:        [{ time, location: [x,y] }]            // only when changed
clicks:        [{ time, location, button, isDown, clickCount }]
scrolls:       [{ time, location, delta: [dx,dy] }]
keys:          [{ time, keyCode, modifiers: [..], isRepeat }]
cursorSprites: [{ id, size, hotspot, png: base64 }]
cursorShapes:  [{ time, sprite }]
```
CG geometry types encode as arrays (`CGRect` → `[[x,y],[w,h]]`). Bump `version` on incompatible changes.

## Sandbox findings (measured, keep the app sandboxed)

- `NSEvent.mouseLocation` polling and global mouse/scroll monitors work without any permission.
- Global `NSEvent` **key** monitors never fire in the sandbox (need Accessibility) — don't use them.
- Listen-only `CGEvent.tapCreate(.cgSessionEventTap, …, .listenOnly)` works once Input Monitoring is
  granted; no entitlement or Info.plist key needed.
- `NSCursor.currentSystem` works in the sandbox.

## Roadmap status

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| F1 input telemetry | Done |
| F2 cursor sprites | Done |
| F3 `.bettercapture` project bundle | **Deferred — build it together with the editor (S1).** Plain `.mov` stays the default; bundle only when telemetry is on; clipboard/notifications must use `screen.mov` inside it |
| F4 pause / resume | Done and verified on real recordings: audio ticks land within ~30 ms across pauses, all tracks match video length (incl. stop while paused) |
| F5 countdown | Next candidate |
| F6 audio robustness (mic hot-swap #208, gain #209, level meters #153) | Todo |
| F7 remember last selection (#172) | Todo |
| F8 Swift 6 language mode | Todo — flip before the editor grows |
| S1+ editor (preview, timeline, auto-zoom, cursor smoothing, backgrounds, export) | Todo, consumes the telemetry JSON |

Reference repos for later work: `syi0808/screenize` and `imbhargav5/open-recorder` are Apache-2.0
(portable with attribution). `lzhgus/Capso` (BSL, bans screen-capture use) and
`lihaoyun6/QuickRecorder` (AGPL) are **ideas only — never copy code**.

## Known open items

- Not yet verified on real recordings: area capture mapping, a window moved/resized mid-recording.
- `RecorderViewModel` is over SwiftLint's type size limit (pre-existing); split it before adding more.

## Verifying against real recordings

Recordings can be scripted: select content once in the menu, then drive the running build with
`open -g -a /tmp/bc-build/dd/Build/Products/Debug/BetterCapture.app "bettercapture://toggle"` (starts
when content is selected, stops when recording) and `bettercapture://pause`. Use `-a` with the path:
a plain `open` may launch another copy (e.g. Xcode's DerivedData build). Play `afplay` ticks at
logged wall times, then check each tick lands where expected in the audio, shifted by the paused time.
Watch the app's logs with `/usr/bin/log stream --level info --predicate 'subsystem == "com.sattlerjoshua.BetterCapture"'`
(the full path matters: in zsh, `log` is a builtin).

Frame-level checks beat eyeballing. With `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` (Homebrew):
- Stream lengths: `ffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=codec_type,duration,nb_frames -of compact <file>`
- Frame at a time: `ffmpeg -ss <t> -i <file> -frames:v 1 out.png`, crop around
  `InputTelemetry.videoPixel(...)` to check the cursor tip lands on the prediction.
